# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

- I definitely feel that I have a stronger grasp of the each method than I did the overall array methods.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

- As I said before, thanks to my productive struggle during the overall array method lesson and taking the time to look up and research how the methods work, I felt comfortable with this lesson as it essentially just piggy backed off of what I had just finished!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

- I still need to practice calling methods and learn how exactly they all (or at least most because there appears to be a huge amount of them) work.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

-Slack has been very useful and if I can't get an answer there, the ruby documentation online as well as general google searches has proven to be a huge asset.
